            [lyric] => There you go
Flashing fever from your eyes
Hey baby, come over here and shut them tight
I'm not denying
We're flying above it all
Hold my hand, don't let me fall
You've such amazing grace
I've never felt this way...

(Chorus)
Oh Show me heaven
Cover me
Leave me breathless
Oh Show me heaven please

Here I go
I'm shaking just like the breeze
Hey baby I need your hand to steady me
I'm not denying
I'm frightened as much as you
Though I'm barely touching you
I've shivers down my spine
And it feels divine

Rep Chorus

If you know what it's like
To dream a dream
Baby hold me tight
And let this be oh

Heaven
Cover me
Leave me breathless
Oh Show me heaven please

Leave me breathless
Leave me breathless
Cover me
Oh yeah..

            [info] => Maria McKee (born Maria Louise McKee, on August 17, 1964 in Los Angeles, California) is an American singer.
 
 A solo artist, McKee was a founding member of the cowpunk/country rock band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lone+Justice" class="bbcode_artist">Lone Justice</a>, in 1982, with whom she released two albums. Her band opened for such acts as U2.
 
 In 1986, she wrote <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Feargal+Sharkey" class="bbcode_artist">Feargal Sharkey</a>'s UK number one hit 'A Good Heart'.
 
 She released her first solo, self-titled album in 1989. Her song &quot;Show Me Heaven&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to the film Days of Thunder, was a number one single in the United Kingdom for four weeks in 1990. Later her eerie, country-tinged single, &quot;If Love Is a Red Dress (Hang Me in Rags)&quot; was released on the soundtrack of Pulp Fiction. (1994).
 
 Her recorded output has varied between the rootsy country-folk of You Gotta Sin To Get Saved (1993) and Peddlin' Dreams  (2005), and experimental rock on Life Is Sweet (1996) and High Dive (2003).  She  even made a foray into early-90s dance music with her &quot;Sweetest Child&quot; single.
 
 Life Is Sweet was seen at the time as an artistic about-face from her country-rock sound, full of guitar feedback and complex, baroque songwriting. Confounding both fans and critics, it was her last release for seven years and her last for a major label.
 
 In 2007 she released Late December, an album rooted in classic 60s pop songwriting.
 
 She is the half-sister of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Love" class="bbcode_artist">Love</a> guitarist/singer/songwriter <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Bryan+Maclean" class="bbcode_artist">Bryan Maclean</a>, with whom she played in a duo as a teenager. In the nineties, she spent time living in Dublin and the East Village.
